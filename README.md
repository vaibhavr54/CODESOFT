I've worked with following projects during my internship period:

### Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction Model

```

## Project Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction Model project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the survival chances of passengers aboard the Titanic. By analyzing historical data on passenger features such as age, gender, class, and fare, we build and evaluate a predictive model that can accurately estimate survival outcomes.

```

### Project 2: Movie Rating Prediction with Python

```
## Project Overview
The Movie Rating Prediction with Python project aims to analyze historical movie data and develop a machine learning model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics. This involves exploring data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and implementing regression techniques for predictive modeling.
