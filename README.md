I've worked with following projects during my internship period:

### Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction Model

```

## Project Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction Model project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the survival chances of passengers aboard the Titanic. By analyzing historical data on passenger features such as age, gender, class, and fare, we build and evaluate a predictive model that can accurately estimate survival outcomes.

### Project 2: Movie Rating Prediction with Python

```
## Project Overview
The Movie Rating Prediction with Python project aims to analyze historical movie data and develop a machine learning model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics. This involves exploring data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and implementing regression techniques for predictive modeling.

### Project 3: Iris Flower classification Machine Learning Model

```
## Project Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, based on their sepal and petal measurements. By utilizing the widely-used Iris dataset, the project demonstrates how to train and evaluate a classification algorithm to accurately identify the species of an Iris flower. The process includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This project serves as an introductory classification task commonly used in data science and machine learning.
