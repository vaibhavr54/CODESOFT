I've worked with following projects during my internship period:

### Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction Model

```markdown

## Project Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction Model project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the survival chances of passengers aboard the Titanic. By analyzing historical data on passenger features such as age, gender, class, and fare, we build and evaluate a predictive model that can accurately estimate survival outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset includes detailed information about Titanic passengers, including:
- PassengerId
- Survived
- Pclass
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp
- Parch
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vaibhavr54/titanic-survival-prediction.git
   cd titanic-survival-prediction
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `TASK1_TITANIC_SURVIVAL_PREDICTION_MODEL.ipynb` to follow along with the analysis and model development.

## Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations can be found in the notebook.
